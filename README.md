## 🧠 Generative-AI Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing concepts, algorithms, and practical applications within the field of **Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, using the **Python** programming language and its powerful machine learning ecosystem.

It serves as a structured learning path covering the fundamentals of Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and the cutting-edge domain of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs).

### 🚀 Key Focus Areas

* **Core Python & Data Structures:** Foundational scripts for data manipulation and programming logic.
* **Machine Learning Fundamentals:** Implementing essential algorithms and concepts (e.g., similarity, regression, classification).
* **Neural Networks:** Building blocks and simple architectures.
* **Large Language Models (LLMs) & Small Language Models (SLMs):** Exploration of text generation, summarizat
* ion, and tokenization techniques.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Practical scripts using libraries like NLTK.

| `variable.py` | Basic variable declaration and use. | **Python Fundamentals** |

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run the scripts in this repository, you will need to have **Python 3.x** installed. Using a virtual environment is highly recommended.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

⚙️ Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Generative-AI.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Generative-AI.git)
cd Generative-AI

2. Install dependencies: Install common libraries used in Generative AI and ML.
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk transformers
